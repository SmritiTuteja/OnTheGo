App developed at 'The Under 25 Hack' event at Bengaluru on 9th January, 2016 <br>

The app was developed under the theme "Make For India". After a lengthy discussion, we have decided to develop and app which will increase the accountability and trasparency of every politicians around the country. And also at the same time, this app will be a helpful companion of Indian Government's [Swachh Bharat Abhiyan scheme] (http://www.swachh.org).

Just snap a picture when you see an incident and post it here. That will be communicated to the people around and also the legislators involved and responsible. We will list down and also the completed issues categorized under every politicians. In that case, it increases their accountability.
